This project is a web-based File Management System that allows users to create, rename, and delete files and directories. The intuitive interface provides a hierarchical view of the file structure, enabling easy navigation and management of files and folders. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system interacts with a backend API for performing file operations. The goal of this project is to simplify file organization and improve productivity with a user-friendly solution.

Feel free to explore and contribute!
